# chitChat
Yet another Peer-to-Peer instant messaging tool.

## Introduction
chitChat is a peer-to-peer instant messaging tool. It's a terminal application, implemented by Java.

## Architecture
**DHT**
chitChat uses a Distributed Hash Table(DHT) to locate each other.

**Networking**
After your client has found other clients, it starts to construct communication between every client.

**Secure**
The networking protocol is gRPG, so the security has already been handled.

## Now
For Version 1.0, there's only one group, and for command line use only.

## Work to do
1. Web-based. Probably will be implemented with JavaScript.
2. Saving history message to local.
3. Groups, credentials.
4. Browser extension.
